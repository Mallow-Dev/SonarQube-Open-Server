# Project Brief

## Purpose

This repository serves as the central development log and project space for creating, configuring, and deploying a SonarQube open server for local development. It provides a complete, production-ready setup for running SonarQube locally using Docker Compose with PostgreSQL as the backend database. This setup enables developers and development teams to perform code quality analysis, identify code smells, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability issues in their codebase.

## Target Users

-   **Developers:** Who want to run SonarQube locally to analyze their code before committing it.
-   **DevOps Engineers:** Who want to experiment with SonarQube and its configuration.
-   **Technical Writers:** Who are documenting the SonarQube setup.
-   **AI Agents:** Who are working on the project.

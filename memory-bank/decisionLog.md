# Decision Log

| Date       | Decision                                               | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 2025-09-21 | Use Docker Compose for container orchestration.        | Docker Compose provides an easy way to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It is well-suited for this project, which consists of multiple services that need to work together.         |
| 2025-09-21 | Use PostgreSQL as the database.                        | PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It is more robust and feature-rich than the embedded H2 database that comes with SonarQube.                               |
| 2025-09-21 | Include the `sonarqube-mcp-server` as a submodule.     | This repository is a development log and project space for creating, configuring, and deploying the SonarQube server. Including the `sonarqube-mcp-server` as a submodule allows for greater control over the experimental feature, and it allows developers to make changes to it if they need to. | 
| 2025-09-21 | Build the `sonarqube-mcp-server` from source.          | Building the `sonarqube-mcp-server` from source provides greater flexibility and control over the experimental feature. It also allows developers to make changes to the server and test them locally. |
| 2025-09-21 | Use `cspell` for spell checking.                       | `cspell` is a command-line tool for spell checking source code. It is easy to use and can be integrated into the development workflow.                                                              |
| 2025-09-21 | Use conventional commits for version control.          | Conventional commits provide a standardized format for commit messages. This makes it easier to understand the history of the project and to generate release notes.                                     |

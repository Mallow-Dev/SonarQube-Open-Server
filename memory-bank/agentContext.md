# Agent Active Context

## Purpose

Track active agent sessions and maintain context continuity across conversations. Each agent maintains their own UUID and updates this file with their current activities.

## Schema

### Agent Entry Format

```yaml
agent_id: UUID (e.g., claude-sonnet-4-20250918-001)
session_start: ISO timestamp
last_update: ISO timestamp
status: active|paused|completed
current_tasks: Array of active tasks
context_summary: Brief description of what agent is working on
memory_references: Links to relevant memory bank entries
```

## Active Sessions

### claude-sonnet-4-20250918-001

- **Session Start**: 2025-09-18T[current_time]
- **Last Update**: 2025-09-21T[current_time]
- **Status**: paused
- **Current Tasks**:
  - Creating agent active context system
  - Reviewing v2 memory bank implementation
  - Updating memory bank with session context
- **Context Summary**: Resuming work on v2 memory bank after VSCode extension conflicts caused by diagram rendering. User had to reload VSCode. Working on implementing agent UUID tracking system.
- **Memory References**:
  - memory-bank/progress.md (for v2 implementation status)
  - memory-bank/systemPatterns.md (for architectural patterns)

### gemini-20250921-001

- **Session Start**: 2025-09-21T[current_time]
- **Last Update**: 2025-09-21T[current_time]
- **Status**: active
- **Current Tasks**:
  - Updating memory bank with current session context.
  - Implementing agent UUID continuity system.
- **Context Summary**: I am Gemini, a new agent on this project. I have reviewed the `memory-bank` to understand the project's context. I am now updating the `agentContext.md` file to reflect my presence and the tasks I am working on.
- **Memory References**:
  - memory-bank/progress.md
  - memory-bank/agentContext.md

### copilot-20250925-001

- **Session Start**: 2025-09-25T02:00:00Z
- **Last Update**: 2025-09-25T02:30:00Z
- **Status**: completed
- **Current Tasks**:
  - Repaired corrupted `docker-compose.yml` and replaced it with a clean canonical file.
  - Updated SonarQube image to `sonarqube:latest` (user-approved option B) and pulled the image.
  - Started the compose stack (db, sonarqube, mcp-server) and validated health/status.
  - Updated memory-bank files with operational changes.
- **Context Summary**: Performed a controlled upgrade to the `latest` SonarQube image after the user authorized the change, repaired compose file corruption introduced during prior automated edits, and validated the running stack. Recommended follow-up: create fresh backups of `sonarqube_data` and `postgresql_data` volumes before making additional changes.
- **Memory References**:
  - memory-bank/progress.md
  - memory-bank/activeContext.md
  - docker-compose.yml

## Session History

- Previous session worked on v2 memory bank implementation
- VSCode extension conflicts occurred with diagram rendering
- User had to reload VSCode, breaking conversation context
- Plugin removal and service restart resolved SonarQube issues

## Notes

- Agents should update their entry whenever starting new tasks
- Include references to memory bank entries being modified
- Track decision points and architectural changes
- Maintain continuity for future agents picking up work

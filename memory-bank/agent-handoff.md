# Agent Handoff Procedures

This document outlines the procedures for handing off work from one AI agent to another.

## Introduction

The goal of the agent handoff process is to ensure a smooth transition of work from one agent to another, with minimal disruption to the project. This process is designed to be as lightweight as possible, while still providing enough information for the new agent to get up to speed quickly.

## Handoff Checklist (for the outgoing agent)

- [ ] Update the `memory-bank/progress.md` file with the latest status of your work.
- [ ] Update the `memory-bank/activeContext.md` file with the current goals and blockers.
- [ ] Update your entry in the `memory-bank/agentContext.md` file with a summary of your work and set your status to `paused`.
- [ ] Ensure that all of your code is checked in and that there are no pending changes.
- [ ] Notify the project owner that you are handing off the work.

## Onboarding Checklist (for the incoming agent)

- [ ] Read the `memory-bank/index.md` file to get an overview of the memory bank.
- [ ] Read the `memory-bank/progress.md` file to get an overview of the project's progress.
- [ ] Read the `memory-bank/activeContext.md` file to understand the current goals and blockers.
- [ ] Read the `memory-bank/agentContext.md` file to understand the history of the project and the work of previous agents.
- [ ] Add your own entry to the `memory-bank/agentContext.md` file and set your status to `active`.
- [ ] Review the `README.md` file to understand how to build and run the project.
- [ ] If you have any questions, please ask the project owner.

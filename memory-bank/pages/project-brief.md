# Project Brief

## Purpose

This repository serves as the central development log and project space for creating, configuring, and deploying a SonarQube open server for local development. It provides a complete, production-ready setup for running SonarQube locally using Docker Compose with PostgreSQL as the backend database. This setup enables developers and development teams to perform code quality analysis, identify code smells, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability issues in their codebase.

## Key Objectives

- **Easy Setup**: Single-command deployment of SonarQube server
- **Production Ready**: Proper database configuration, security, and persistence
- **Developer Friendly**: Includes development overrides and comprehensive documentation
- **Scalable**: Configurable resource allocation and environment-specific settings
- **Secure**: Best practices for credential management and access control

## Target Users

- **Individual Developers**: Want to analyze their code locally before pushing to CI/CD
- **Development Teams**: Need shared SonarQube instance for code quality standards
- **DevOps Engineers**: Setting up code quality gates and integration with CI/CD pipelines
- **Open Source Contributors**: Testing code analysis locally before contributing
- **Educational Users**: Learning code quality analysis tools and best practices

## Value Proposition

- **Zero Setup Time**: Docker-based deployment eliminates complex installation
- **Cost Effective**: Uses free SonarQube Community Edition
- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-specific settings for different deployment scenarios
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Ready-to-use guides and troubleshooting
- **Best Practices**: Follows Docker, security, and database best practices
- **Extensible**: Easy to add plugins, custom rules, and integrations

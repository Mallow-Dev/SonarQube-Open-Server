# Active Context

## Current Goals

- Complete the implementation of the v2 memory bank.
- Ensure stable diagram rendering.
- Provide examples for SonarQube analysis.
- Document troubleshooting and agent handoff procedures.
- Operational tasks (updated 2025-09-25): repair and validate `docker-compose.yml`, upgrade SonarQube image to `sonarqube:latest`, start the stack and verify health.

## Current Blockers

- None blocking right now; SonarQube stack is up. Recommended: create fresh backups of data volumes before making configuration or plugin changes.

Hereâ€™s a high-level plan for setting up SonarQube Community Edition in Docker using a modern, secure configuration with Docker Compose:

1. Define requirements and best practices for SonarQube in Docker.
2. Create a secure and production-ready `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Add environment variables for security and performance.
4. Configure persistent storage for SonarQube and PostgreSQL.
5. Set up a dedicated PostgreSQL service for SonarQube.
6. Document network, port, and user access settings.
7. Provide instructions for starting, stopping, and maintaining the stack.

Would you like to proceed with this plan and generate the Docker Compose file?

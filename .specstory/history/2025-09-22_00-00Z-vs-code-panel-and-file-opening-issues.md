I'll check your VS Code workspace settings to find settings that change editor/panel behavior, then propose and apply fixes to restore the usual behavior (single editor tab reused for preview and panels close when empty). I'll: 1) read `settings.json`, 2) identify problematic settings, 3) update them to recommended defaults, 4) report changes and how to revert.

I'll start by listing the plan and mark the first todo as in-progress. I'll open your workspace `settings.json` to look for settings that affect editor preview, splitting, and panel behavior. I expect to find keys like `workbench.editor.enablePreview`, `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromQuickOpen`, `workbench.editor.openSideBySideDirection`, `workbench.panel.defaultLocation`, or `workbench.activityBar` and will report findings. Now I'll read the file. I'll check your user-level VS Code settings file at the standard Linux path to look for global settings that override workspace defaults. I'll open `settings.json` (and if that doesn't exist, I'll try the Code - OSS path). I'll search the workspace for any settings mentioning editor/panel behavior to find overrides. I'll run a workspace grep for "workbench" and related keys. I'm going to update the todo list to mark the workspace-settings inspection done and start the "identify problematic settings" step. This is just a status update (no file edits yet).

I'll search the web for exact VS Code setting names that control editor preview behavior and panel closing so I can give precise changes to suggest. I'll look up "preview editor", "openPositioning", and "close panels when empty" setting names.
